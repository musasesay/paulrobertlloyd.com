My first listen of the band playing live since the end of last summer, and also my first chance to hear live, some of the songs from the band's demo CD.

Unfortunately, Teller were moved down from third spot, to the become the first band to play, and so of course this meant that very few people were around to hear them play -- the atmosphere was a little subdued and I think this effected the bands performance.

Of the whole gig, I thought the first and last songs were the best, a definite improvement to hear them live (not a criticism of the recorded stuff mind) so you could say they dipped in the middle!

Overall, a fine performance, although I did leave feeling a little underwhelmed -- especially as their set seemed shorter than usual.
