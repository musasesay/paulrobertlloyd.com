nGenera Corporation (now [Moxie Software][1]) helps corporations and governments transform themselves into next-generation enterprises through an integrated platform of on-demand technology and innovative business research.

Formally known as BSG Alliance, Steve Douty (President of Platform, Applications and Marketing) asked me to take their new name and build a brand around it. With a growing suite of software products and consultation services, I created an extensible system around a distinctive 'nG' icon.

I then sought to distinguish nGenera's web presence by creating an immersive and premium experience, realised through the use of deep blues accented by colours from a complementary palette. Working with [Matt Pearson][2], I produced an [innovative carousel device][3] for use on the homepage, that introduced customers to the company's broad range of products and services.
