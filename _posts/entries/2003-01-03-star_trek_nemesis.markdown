Apparently it is a well known fact that every evenly numbered Star Trek movie is worthy of watching.

This being the 10th and also perhaps the last to feature the TNG crew you would assume that, for even a viewer with little knowledge of Star Trek, this film would be enjoyable. However although interesting in places, this film is just a tad cheesy -- especially within the relationships between the films characters and during the start of the film. Overall a pleasant film but nothing special -- certainly not as good as others in the series or previous films.
