excerpt: Another night in Lichfield
---
Another night down Lichfield -- I guess you could argue to celebrate Kris' birthday except nobody knew! Thanks to Sarah and Aimeé for visiting the site, notice how I'm deliberately mentioning you so I can't be accused of writing about people you don't know!

A really good night -- these mid-week meetings in the cathedral city always seem to be. Made even better by being constantly complemented by Aimeé -- an experience in itself!
