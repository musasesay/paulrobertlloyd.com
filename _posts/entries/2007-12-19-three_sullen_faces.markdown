Having spent the best part of two years abroad, I'm finding it easier to guess where people come from by their appearance alone.

On Monday, as I waited at the airport for my much delayed flight back to the UK, I spotted a family of three sitting across from me in a restaurant.

Gloomy faced, seemingly moaning, and with looks of disgust, they displayed all the characteristics of a typical British family. I tried to sit close enough so I could hear their accents, but these were hard to make our from their muffled grumbling. So upon finishing my meal, I walked past their table on my way out. Sure enough I was right.
