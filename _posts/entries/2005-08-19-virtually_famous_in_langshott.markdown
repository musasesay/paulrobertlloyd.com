Whilst fixing some css bugs for the next revision of the rdc* theme I had an interesting thought regarding its code name: does it rank higher in Google than the village it's named after?

## Background
Two months ago, [Jon][1] asked me if I would like to join him on a little project he had started, designing a theme for [WordPress][2]. The answer was yes, and my design can be seen in the [current v0.6 release][3].

Before launch I was asked if I would like to give the design a code name. Being a man fond of his code names (at [work][4] we already have OVAL and PIP thanks to me), I jumped at the chance!  Wanting something personal to me, but also a little different, and seeing as locations are often inspiration for code names, I decided upon 'Langshott', the small little village in Horley where I grew up.

## The Answer

With a number of users having installed the theme, and linking to the theme site, the theme is *ranked 2nd* in Google under the search term ['Langshott'][5], and my name appears in third place!  It's like being virtually famous!

As to the theme, me and Jon have quite a few ideas as to where we want to take it before we release version 1.0, so keep an eye on the [theme site][6]!
