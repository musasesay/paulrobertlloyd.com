The inter-store football match has finally been played. Apparently Walsall had been training in the weeks leading up to this match -- but Bescot, with a team assembled on the same day trounced them 8-0!

Tyrone was named Man of the Match, but all the lads played well -- goals from Lee (who also missed two clear chances and a penalty), Simon, Aaron, Tyrone and an own-goal -- though Carl took the credit for that one! There was more bad news for Walsall with the game finishing with a broken ankle to one of their players.

I wrote the following match report for the crew to read:

> ## Glorious victory for 9 man Bescot -- embarrassment and injury for Walsall
>
> Last nights big match saw victory for Lee Millington's men against his old team -- Walsall Town. Millington had assembled a new side that contained new signings Matthew's and Jones, as well as a first play for Robert Hamett from the U10's.
>
> The game kicked of very much as it was to continue. The first goal came seven minutes into the game with a tap in from Simon Jones, leaving the Walsall keeper stunned. Walsall failed to respond, and a second goal soon followed from the player/manager against his former team mate -- Mark Parker.
>
> A few attempts towards goal came Bescot's way, but they failed against a stubborn defence -- Lloyd clearing many of the shoots into row Z! Dirty tricks were to follow, with diving and foul throw-ins a plenty. The first half finished with a strike on goal from Carl James, deflected in by a woman in the Walsall side!
>
> The second half carried on much in the same vain as the first -- goals coming thick and fast -- two more from Jones and Taggar who between them worked like a dream. Millington also scored his second, but sadly missed two open goals and missed a penalty. However, it was Matthew's that showed his worth, worthy of being named Man of the Match -- excellent in defence and covering the few holes that appeared in it. Tyrone's finest minute came in the 70th minute -- wrestling the ball of a Walsall player in the Bescot goal mouth before turning round, striding up the pitch and scoring a fantastic goal.
>
> However, the whole team worked well together, unlike the opposition who quickly collapsed -- lacking any real communication between the players except for insults and bickering. Millington said after the game "this was a five star performance -- the lads did well".
>
> The game sadly ended in more tragedy for Walsall -- the 90th minute and a crude tackle by James in fading light left one of their players taken of the pitch on a stretcher -- their team doctor later confirming that she had broken her ankle.
