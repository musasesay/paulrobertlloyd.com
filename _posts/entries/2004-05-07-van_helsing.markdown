Your typical Transylvanian horror/action movie, but with some nice twists... and Kate Beckinsale!

I like the idea of mixing together all the characters from different horror movies and bringing them together -- Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, Frakinstein and his monster and of course Dracula -- they're all here.

I also loved the part of the film in the Vatican where the film mocked the James Bond movies with a medieval take on gadgets, guns and all other things that explode, with a special emphasis on crucifix, holy water, and wooden stakes.

Overall, a good entertaining movie.
