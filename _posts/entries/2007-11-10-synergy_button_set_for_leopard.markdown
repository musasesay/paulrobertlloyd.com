![](/assets/images/2007/11/tabbedleopard.png){: .pull-right} One of the tiny little annoyances with the upgrade to Leopard, was that Synergy, a great little application that provides control of iTunes from the menu bar, looked a little unpolished when using the 'Tabbed' style interface.

I managed to survive a week noticing the white artefacts around it's edges, but come Friday night last week, I just had to create my own button set, which I imaginatively called *'Tabbed Leopard'*.

This updated button set is based on the original 'Tabbed' style, yet aside from removing the white artefacts from the edges, it also removes the subtle pin-stripes and introduces a level of transparency to match the behaviour of the menu bar in Leopard.
