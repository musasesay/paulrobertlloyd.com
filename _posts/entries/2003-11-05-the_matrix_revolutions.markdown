So here we are -- the conclusion of the Matrix Trilogy. Of course every film released now days is part of a trilogy as part of obvious marketing exercises and you do wonder weather the Matrix falls into this category.

Watching the second film after such a long time seeing the first hindered my experience a little, but luckily I had watched Reloaded a few days before seeing Revolutions which helped a lot. Watching it in the City where this film was made (Sydney) also meant some added excitement -- but enough of that already!

Where as the first film had the challenge of meeting the quality and marvel of the first (and to that extent, failed), this film had the advantage of you wanting to find out the conclusion to the story. Again this film went overboard with the CGI to the same unnecessary degree, but in some cases I feel it can be let of due to the enormity of the action being portrayed.

Unlike the first two -- the film seemed to have more funnier moments to lighten the load a little -- such as a blind Neo telling Trinity that she'll have to drive. But Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith was without doubt the highlight of this particular instalment.

As intended, a very thought provoking film essentially about love and a belief in love. That's how I viewed it anyway. The ending perhaps a little soppy, but at least the whole trilogy seems to have been tied up and explained.
