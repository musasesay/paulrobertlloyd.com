Thanks to Kris and his continuing post-oz depression, I seem to have been talked in to joining alongside his New Years Resolution of doing something adventurous/mildly dangerous (in other words, stupid) every month this year -- starting February. First on the list is looking like abseiling in North Wales, but soon to be followed by white water rafting, parachute jumping and God knows what else! Should be fun though and help keep my mind of a few things.
