This year is a little different from previous years in that I won't be running the Great North Run, but hopefully running at a number of smaller events will still give me the opportunity to raise lots of money for charity!

## Great Manchester Run: Run for Simone
The first event I've signed up for takes place soon after my arrival on British soil in May: the Great Manchester Run 2006. I really enjoyed this event last year, especially since I actually managed to run the 10km distance without stopping! This year I will be hoping to beat last years time, and also raise money for a charity close to my heart.

As you may or may not know, the end of last year ended on a low for everyone at my previous company Orange Vision, with [the passing of Simone][1], the Office Manager. Having been diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease only months earlier, it was still a shock to us all. However, up until this time, Simone was full of life and kindness, and I believe this is something to celebrate at this years run.

Thanks to Orange Vision, [a Tribute fund was set up in her memory][2] (that in turn raises money for the [Motor Neurone Disease Association][3]), and I have decided to run for this charity, with a fund raising target of £350.

## Run for Moore
The second event I have lined up is one that will be taking place just down the road from me at Sandwell Valley Park as I '[Run for Moore][4]'. This new event from the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK has been designed to coincide with the 40th anniversary celebrations of England's 1966 World Cup win (and perhaps a win in 2006 too) and is taking place at six venues across the UK throughout the summer.

Whilst only a 5km run, I'm still hoing I can raise a respectable amount of money for my favourite charity. I am going to be a bit checky and suggest that being half the length of the Great Manchester Run, that you sponsor me half the amount again for this run too (that is to say please be generous!)

As these look set to be the only events I will be participating in this year (though a half marathon would be nice too), please be generous and dig deep! Ideally I would like to beat the massive amount raised last year (nearly £500!) thanks to everybodies fantastic support, which I hope can replicated again this year. You know what to do!
