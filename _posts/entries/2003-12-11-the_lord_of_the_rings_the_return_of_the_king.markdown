So finally we reach the final part of this much acclaimed trilogy, but conceivably its at this point that the adaptation would either succeed or fail. Unlikely given the quality of the previous two films but a possibility none the less.

The third film continues to follow Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) as they carry the ring to Mount Doom and its destruction. The film continues in the same vain as the second with some truly magnificent battle scenes interlaced with comical and also sombre moments -- totally engrossing and superbly shoot.

The films length is perhaps the only issue you may have with it, yet I expect this was necessary to adequately cover the story of the original novel. This is especially true of the films ending -- or more accurately endings about 5 of them!

Again the fine New Zealand landscape is the setting and responsible for a good part of this films beauty. However credit must be given to the set and costumes designers, as well as the special effects artists. I've heard cast members (realistically given the progress of technology) saying that although the film will stand the test of time, the effects may not. I cant see how, because they are extremely realistic.

I had to pull myself out of the film to remind myself what i was watching was a true epic. People talk about being blown away when watching Star Wars during the 70's -- such films viewed on like an event. The same is true here.
