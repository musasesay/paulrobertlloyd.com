As the nights draw in, and the hot summer days fade into distant memory (the last hot summer day being August 2003) I've realised that this is my favourite time of year. It's taken me this long to work it out, but something about the cold fresh air, the smell of the central heating and decent films appearing at the cinema. It's nice don't you think?
