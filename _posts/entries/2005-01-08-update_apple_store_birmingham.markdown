Further to this post last year, and the announcement of a [new Apple Store in Birmingham][1], today I saw the site of the new store in Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre.

It looks like quite a small store is planned which is a shame, but it does have a location just beyond the main entrance from New Street/High Street, so it least it will be highly visible.
