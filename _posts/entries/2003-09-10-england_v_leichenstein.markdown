My first England game and what better place to watch it than at the theatre of dreams -- Old Trafford. The first half was quite a dull affair with the fans cheering the flight of paper planes onto the pitch rather than the players.

The second half and two goals from Rooney and Owen in the first ten or so minutes and it was looking like the goals would start rushing in. They didn't, but the result was good enough to mean only a draw is needed in Turkey.
