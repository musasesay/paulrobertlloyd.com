Two recent conversations have revealed to me my inner cynicism for web2.0 and all that surrounds me in the valley.

## Conversation with an immigration officer on Monday
CBP Officer
: "What is your profession?"

Me
: "Web Designer"[^1]

CBP Officer
: "Who do you work for?"

Me
: "A start up called Ning"

CBP Officer
: "How do you guys actually make money?"

Me
: "We are supported by advertising... do any companies in Silicon Valley actually make any money!?"

CBP Officer
: "Well Google do, right?"

Me
: "Exactly!"

## Conversation with [Yoz Grahame][1], former colleague and fellow Brit, currently at Linden Lab
Me
: I'm just getting a bit tired of web2.0 - its all fluff

Yoz
: want some SUBSTANCE

Me
: Please. I mean, very few of these products are actually useful - they create problems, then provide the solutions

Me
: Problem: I can't tell everyone in the world what kind of jam I'm having on my toast
: Solution: Twitter

Yoz
: :-)

Me
: Problem: I can't call myself Mandy and dress up like a goat
: Solution: Second Life

Yoz
: ok, that made my day

Me
: Here's the real problem - people are not socialising, because they are sat on their fat arses, 'social networking'

Yoz
: ha

Me
: It's insane - just go to the pub!

[^1]: I usually try to stay clear of calling myself a web designer, often preferring 'Web Developer' or 'Graphic Designer'. Web Designer just sounds like I design websites on FrontPage in my bedroom.
