Being an avid viewer of David Letterman I had seen all the clips and interviews and I couldn't wait for this films UK release. It could have still been a stinker, thankfully it was anything but.

Adam Sandler plays as a womanising zoo vet who falls for Lucy (Drew Barrymore) one day in a local Hawaiian caf√©. However she has short-term memory loss and can't remember him at all the next day -- so he has to win her affection, each and every day with varied success to start with.

This is the second time Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have come together after their pairing in the Wedding Singer. Also starring Rob Scheider, it is left to him to provide most of the gross out comedy, allowing Adam Sandler to concentrate on the more heart warming aspects of the film and it works a treat. With an ending that could easily have been a cop-out (and then her memory came back), instead a different more believable path is taken, and it's yet another reason why this film was so enjoyable.

This is definitely one I'll be buying on DVD, and when that time comes I'll post a far more comprehensive review, as this film, the best one I've seen so far in 2004, deserves it.
