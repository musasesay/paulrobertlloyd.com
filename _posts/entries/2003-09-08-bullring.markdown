I went to the newly opened Bullring shopping center in Birmingham today, and I must say I was very impressed. To me, the city makes more sense now, like it's finally joined up.

Much thought has been given to the way in which it merges into New Street and High Street, and remaining sixties relics such as the Rotuna begin to look nice again. Furthermore, St. Martins Church is now in a far more aesthetically pleasing setting, no longer hidden amongst a sprawling concrete mess.
