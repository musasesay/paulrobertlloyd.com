Having read [Doug Bowman's thoughts regarding iPhoto/MT integration], I am of course compelled to think of the possibilities for my own site.

Thinking about it -- albeit quickly and without much thought -- it would make sense to not only publish my photos using this system, but also publish my (increasingly rare) reviews via MT.

Whilst it suddenly all makes sense, much tinkering and fiddling with Movable Type (that still outputs a blog with calendar problems) may in the end just put me off. But something to think about anyway.
