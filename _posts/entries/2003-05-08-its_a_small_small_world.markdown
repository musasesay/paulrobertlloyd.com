Wednesday saw me, Kris and John spending the day at Manchester's Trafford Center, watching me spend far to many dollars, before hooking up with Lee on the night in Wednesbury.

To my surprise, who should I bump into, but my Great Great Grandfather by means of his picture being on the wall; he looked remarkably similar to my dad! Apparently, his name is Frederick Henry Lloyd, and he owned a steelworks in the town.

It really is a strange, yet comforting feeling, and makes this place seem even more like my home.
