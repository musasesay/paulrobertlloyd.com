excerpt: If ever there was a reason to return to the States as quickly as possible, it would be to see the new Aaron Sorkin drama series 'Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'.

Dubbed by many as the West Wing meets Hollywood, <cite>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</cite> stars many of my favourite actors from that show including [Bradley Whitford][1] (who played Josh Lyman), [Matthew Perry][2] (Joe Quincy), [Timothy Busfield][3] (Danny Concannon) and surely it's a matter of time before [Joshua Malina][4] appears on the new show too (having appeared in every Aaron Sorkin project to date). It also stars [Nate Corddry][5], who will be familiar to [Daily Show][6] viewers.

I'm really looking forward to this one, and should hopefully fill the gap left by the axed West Wing. <cite>Studio 60</cite> airs 'in the fall' in the States on NBC, but I would imagine it would arrive in the UK the beginning of next year, and no doubt on Channel 4.
