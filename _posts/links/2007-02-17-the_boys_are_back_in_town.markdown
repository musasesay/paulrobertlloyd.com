Apologies if those of you in the UK are already sick to death of seeing this advert (I'm guessing it's being shown quite a bit right now), but I've just discovered that the [ITV Digital Monkey][1] and his friend Al ([Johnny Vegas][2]) are back on the telly, this time advertising PG Tips! For those of you outside the UK, let me formally (re)introduce you to Monkey...

Better still, it's all for a good cause, as PG Tips are raising money for this years [Comic Relief][3] -- I'll leave my usual corporate scepticism to one side for the time being.
