Playback is the TV-on-DVD label of Universal Pictures in the UK, responsible for releasing content from NBCUniversal as well as other acquired series on DVD and Blu-ray disc. Its website acts as an information hub for these shows, providing news, photos, and behind-the-scenes videos and interviews.

I created a modular design that could showcase differing types of content. As Playback acts as a supporting brand to the various television shows it releases, an element of customisation was added, allowing site editors to choose a colour palette that would coordinate with each shows branding.
