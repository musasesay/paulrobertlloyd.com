Mozilla Add-ons is a catalogue of over 6,000 add-ons that let Firefox users customise the browser to suit their individual interests and needs.

The previous site was extremely functional and proved unappealing to users who were less tech savvy. Working at Clearleft alongside [Richard Rutter][1], [Natalie Downe][2] and [Anna Debenham][3] I helped reposition Mozilla's Add-ons so that it was more consumer orientated and approachable.
