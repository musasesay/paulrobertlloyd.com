Cheers to everyone who came out Friday night (Wednesbury) and Saturday night (Lichfield) to celebrate my 24th birthday. Friday night was a bit crap frankly, considering it was essentially highjacked by Rob. Lichfield was far more enjoyable, especially seeing all those old school photos round Aime√©'s afterwards -- if I wasn't feeling old enough already!
