Only at an anti Iraq war demo in Palo Alto could a fight break out. The dialogue between a demonstrator, and a couple of bystanders went something like this:

Demonstrator
: Thanks for your support sir! All the best to you and your children!

Bystander
: I don't have any children...

Demonstrator (walking away)
: Son of a bitch!

Second Bystander
: Hey, watch your language!

Demonstrator (aggressive)
: What did you say?

Second Bystander
: There was no call for that...

...and before the fight could begin the police stepped in! And you wonder why America has trouble 'liberating' Iraq...
