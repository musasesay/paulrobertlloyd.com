I was never a big fan of the first instalment of Gran Turismo; largely because my brother always wiped my memory card, removing my garage, the odd 'B' class licence and the small wad of cash I had built up. Arcade mode pissed me off too, becoming boring after just a few races. Marketed on its realism and its graphics, I always thought this was a little misplaced.

Finally, being at uni and having the freedom to play on my PlayStation without my brother's involvement, and the fact I can't be bothered writing up that archaeology essay _just yet_, I now understand what all the fuss was about. The graphics still aren't that spectacular, but I accept that the replays are pretty fine, and for a 32-bit console (you always seem to forget that with the PlayStation) you do feel the need for speed. Building up your garage, getting your first million, blowing it on a Jaguar XJ220 and realising that that was a stupid idea, buying a Mini Cooper just because you want one in real life and this is as close as you'll get. You got it, I'm engrossed in this game -- if only I could master the new rally stages! One annoying aspect of the game is when in 2-player mode, the on-screen graphics obstruct your view of the racetrack -- crunch!

The game boosts a far greater collection of cars as well as tracks, competitions, licences and the ability to accelerate time as you decide to have a quick half an hour session on GT2 at 12:30pm, and twelve hours later... SHIT! I don't like Monday's anyway, but the last few Sundays have been a blur.

As a testament to this game, I always enjoyed playing my PlayStation, but rarely used it. I've decided to get a PS2 (and GT2000) and plan to be the first in the queue. As for FIFA 2000 -- a great game, but since buying GT2 it's started to collect dust!
