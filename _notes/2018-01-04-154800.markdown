“I always think that there are two products at the end of a programme; there is the physical product or the service, the thing that you have managed to make, and then there is all that you have learned. The power of what you have learned enables you to do the next thing and it enables you to do the next thing better.” — [Jony Ive](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/jony-ive-apple-park)
