This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [Atom][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Calibre][5] which is designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][6] and these supporting plugins:
