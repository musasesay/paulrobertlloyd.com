This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [Atom][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Calibre][5] which is designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][6] and these supporting plugins:

  * [jekyll-paginate-v2][7] by Sverrir Sigmundarson

  * [jekyll-slugify_underscore][9] by Paul Robert Lloyd

Other notable tools and services used to build this site include:

  * [fontfaceobserver][10] by Bram Stein

Pages are semantically structured using valid [HTML5][12] with presentational design provided by [CSS][13]. Syndicated feeds available as Atom-flavoured RSS or [JSON][14].
