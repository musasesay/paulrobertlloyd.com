This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [Atom][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Calibre][5] which is designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][6] and these supporting plugins:

  * [jekyll-figure][7] by Paul Robert Lloyd
  * [jekyll-paginate-v2][8] by Sverrir Sigmundarson
  * [jekyll-sitemap][9] by GitHub, Inc.
  * [jekyll-slugify_underscore][10] by Paul Robert Lloyd

Other notable tools and services used to build this site include:

  * [fontfaceobserver][11] by Bram Stein
  * [MapBox][12] by Mapbox Inc.

Pages are semantically structured using valid [HTML5][13] with presentational design provided by [CSS][14]. Syndicated feeds available as [Atom][15]-flavoured RSS or [JSON][16].
