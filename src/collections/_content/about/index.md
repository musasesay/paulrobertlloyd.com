title: About Me
excerpt: 'I''m Paul, an independent designer, writer and speaker based in Brighton, England. I work with responsible organisations to create purposeful digital products. I value cohesiveness, attention to detail, and developing products that can be used by everyone, however they may choose to access them.'
---
In the past, I have worked with companies such as <cite>The Guardian</cite>, UNICEF, John Lewis, Mozilla and a number of other clients during my time at [Clearleft][1].

As an interaction designer, I look to create engaging and usable experiences. As a front-end developer, I employ pragmatic architectures to progressively enhance semantic, accessible HTML with modular CSS and unobtrusive JavaScript. As a hybrid of the two, I produce style guides and component libraries so the code I hand over can be maintained and built upon by internal teams.

I enjoy working alongside other designers, developers and researchers whenever possible. Living in Brighton, means I'm within commuting distance of London, although I relish the opportunity to work with organisations who may be located further afield.

[I have also spoken at events][2] around the UK and Europe. I typically talk the universal nature of the web, and embracing the aesthetic results this may produce, and like to reference my other interests in politics, architecture and sustainability.

*If you're interested in working with me on your next project, or would like me to speak at your event, [please get in touch][3].*
