Smallness has always been part of my nature, be it [needing to take growth hormone][1] when I was younger, or even the fact that [my name][2] comes from the Roman family name _Paulus_ meaning "small" or "humble" in Latin. My short stature was never an issue, in fact, it was an integral part of my identity growing up. Perhaps this is why I'm rarely impressed by scale, and have a distaste for monopolies and large corporations.

Speed has never been one of my strengths, either. At school sports days, I often finished last (but would get the loudest cheer). I've always been a slow eater too, but rarely get indigestion.

These aspects of my personality I'm familiar with, but recently I have come to acknowledge a third[^1]. Although design gets conflated with the production of something new, its actually the act of [improving what already exists][3] -- organising a room, editing a text, refining an interface, refactoring a codebase -- that I enjoy the most.

While others were wooed by the idea of designing for billions, the idea made me feel queasy. So did the thought of working for a large organisation, [although I gave it a try][4]. While others moved fast, eager to ship whatever they had built, I remained cautious, avoiding the frameworks and fads, instead doubling down on the foundational aspects of my craft. Today, as we come to terms with [the wreckage wrought by all this hastiness][5], I find myself eager to fix things; slowly, one small piece at a time. I hope you will join me.

[^1]: While I take a degree of pride in these aspects, it's probaly worth acknowledging these as biases before I approach any new work.
