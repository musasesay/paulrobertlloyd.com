That was the answer I gave [Kate](https://twitter.com/qwertykate) when she asked why I thought Brexit might not happen. I was quoting Harold Macmillan, who said this in response to a question about what would most likely knock a government off course – although [some dispute](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3577416/As-Macmillan-never-said-thats-enough-quotations.html) whether he ever actually said this.

At the time, I wrongly attributed this quote to James Callaghan, but had confused it with: “A lie can be halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on”. However, in his [address to the Commons](hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1976/nov/01/conduct-of-members-1#S5CV0918P0_19761101_HOC_208), Callaghan was quoting a phrase used [in some form or other](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/13/truth/) since the 18th century.

Where’s a [Winston Churchill quote](https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/quotes-falsely-attributed/) when you need one.
