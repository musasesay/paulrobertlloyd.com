The Beauty of Transport is such a compelling read. @danielhwrightâ€™s latest article goes into fantastic detail about [the sadly short-lived identity for Rail express systems](https://thebeautyoftransport.com/2018/04/18/resplendence-rail-express-systems-1991-corporate-identity-roundel-design-group-uk/), a programme I distinctly remember poring over as a 12-year-old train livery geek. So, so good.
