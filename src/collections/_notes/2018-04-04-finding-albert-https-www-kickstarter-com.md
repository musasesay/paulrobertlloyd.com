[Finding Albert](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cole007/finding-albert-illustrating-a-family-story) is a heartwarming family history research project, with the end result being a hand drawn graphic novel. I’m so happy @cole007 has met his funding target, but there are stretch goals. If you haven’t backed it yet, you have just a few days to do so; go pledge!
