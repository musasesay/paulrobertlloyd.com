Our industry has approached a turning point in how we develop websites. As the number of devices we need to accommodate increases, so the flexibility and adaptability of our designs needs greater consideration. Yet at the same time, designers need constraints and creative control over a project.

In this session, Paul will discuss how clearly communicating the fundamental aspects of your design during different stages of a project can help you better communicate with clients, developers and your peers, ensuring your vision doesn't get lost in the transformation from static comp to dynamic, every changing website.
