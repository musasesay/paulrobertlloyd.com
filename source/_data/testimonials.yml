    > I've worked alongside some of the most brilliant interaction and graphic designers in the world in my career, but Paul is one of the most talented and consistently impressive designers I've met. Beyond driving most of Apture's graphic, interaction and web design work, he cares deeply about building beautiful, visually organised products, which I think is why we both got along in the first place.

    > Paul is an excellent designer and front end developer. He has a lot of experience working with UX designers and researchers, and is comfortable collaborating in that tricky zone where the UX hasn't yet been worked out, the client's business goals are up in the air and the whole project is a tangle that needs careful unpicking before being put back together again.

    > Paul is hands down the best web designer and CSS craftsman I have had the pleasure of working with. From overall user experience to the smallest, pixel-tweaking details, Paul is exceptionally creative and thoughtful.
