  title: Hello
  text: |
    I'm [Paul Robert Lloyd][1]{: .p-name .u-url}, a [graphic designer][2]{: .p-role}, [writer][3]{: .p-role} and [speaker][4]{: .p-role} who lives in beautiful [Brighton][5]{: .p-locality}, [England][6]{: .p-country-name}.
    {: .h-card}
    
    Specialising in interaction design and front-end web development, I've worked with publishers ([Dennis][7], [MATTER][8]), media companies ([Channel 4][9], [NBCUniversal][10]) and charities ([UNICEF][11], [DACS][12]). I advocate [collaborative practice][13], [systems thinking][14] and [embracing the inherent nature of the web][15].
    
    In my spare time I'm either working on [side projects][16], planning [adventures abroad][17] or volunteering; I was a [Games Maker][18] at London 2012 and [Clyde-sider][19] at Glasgow 2014.
    
    One day I will get a dog.

    I love working with ethical and sustainable businesses who are creating a positive and measurable impact in society.
    
    With over ten years agency and in-house experience, I'm comfortable with every stage of the product design process, from sketching on whiteboards, creating visual comps or building modular front-end component libraries.
    
    I'm available to take on new engagements from May 2015.
