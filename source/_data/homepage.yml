    I'm **Paul Robert Lloyd**{: .p-name}, a [designer][2], [writer][3] and [speaker][4] who lives in beautiful [Brighton][5]{: .p-locality}, [England][6]{: .p-country-name}.

    Specialising in graphic design and front-end web development, I advocate [collaborative practice][13], [systems thinking][14] and [embracing the universal nature of the web][15].
    
    I enjoy working on [side projects][16], planning [adventures][17] and volunteering; I was a [Games Maker][18] at London 2012 and [Clyde-sider][19] at Glasgow 2014.
    
    One day I will get a dog.

    With over ten years agency and in-house experience, I'm comfortable with every stage of the design process, from sketching on whiteboards, creating visual comps or building modular front-end component libraries. [Get in touch][1] and we can discuss your needs.
