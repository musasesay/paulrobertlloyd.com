## Testimonials
{% figure "<cite>Harry Brignull, UX consultant</cite>" %}
> Paul is an excellent designer and front end developer. He has a lot of experience working with UX designers and researchers, and is comfortable collaborating in that tricky zone where the UX hasn't yet been worked out, the client's business goals are up in the air and the whole project is a tangle that needs careful unpicking before being put back together again.

## Services

### Design
I believe that by developing common design and interaction patterns, we can combine the systems of the web and graphic design to great effect. I value cohesiveness and attention to detail, and designing products that can be used by all.

### Front-end development
I employ pragmatic front-end architecture practices that progressively enhance semantic HTML with modular CSS and unobtrusive JavaScript. I advocate tools like style guides and pattern portfolios that encourage collaboration within teams.

### Writing and speaking
I like to share accumulated knowledge with my peers, and have written articles for publications like net Magazine, A List Apart and 24 ways. I have also spoken at design conferences around the UK and Europe.
