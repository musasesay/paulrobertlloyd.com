I'm Paul, a graphic designer, writer and speaker who lives in beautiful Brighton, England.

Specialising in interaction design and front-end web development, I currently work for the [Guardian][1] in London. Prior to this I was a senior designer at user experience design agency [Clearleft][2], and before that lead designer at [Ning][3], a technology startup based in Palo Alto, California.

I've worked on [a number of projects][4] for publishers (Dennis Publishing, MATTER); entertainment companies (BBC, Channel 4, NBCUniversal); and charitable organisations (UNICEF, Mozilla, DACS). I advocate a collaborative design approach that acknowledges both the limits and opportunities of the web.

In my spare time I can be found working on side projects (I'm currently digitising [George Bradshaw's railway guide][5]), writing for magazines, speaking at events, or planning my next adventure abroad -- because I really need to get out more! I also enjoy volunteering at large events; I was a [Games Maker at London 2012][6], and a [Clyde-sider at Glasgow 2014][7].

On this site I write about what crosses my mind. Topics include [brand identity][8], [web design and development][9], [travel][9] and [politics][10]. Less considered thoughts can be found on [Twitter][11], while works in progress can be found on [Dribbble][12] and [GitHub][13].
