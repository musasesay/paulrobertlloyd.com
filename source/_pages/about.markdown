I'm Paul, a graphic designer, aspiring writer and occasional speaker who lives in beautiful Brighton, England.

Specialising in interaction design and front-end web development, I currently work for the [Guardian][1] in London. Prior to this I was a senior designer at the renowned user experience design agency [Clearleft][2] and before that lead designer at [Ning][3], a technology start-up based in Palo Alto, California.

I've worked on [a range of projects][4] for publishers (Dennis, MATTER), entertainment companies (BBC, Channel 4, NBCUniversal) and charitable organisations (UNICEF, Mozilla, DACS), the latter or which I enjoy most. I advocate a design approaches that acknowledges both the limits and opportunities of the web.

In my spare time I can be found working on side projects (I'm currently digitising [George Bradshaw's railway guide][5]), writing for magazines, speaking at events or planning my next adventure because I really need to get out more.

This site is a place for me to write about things that cross my mind; topics covered usual include brand identity, web development, travel and politics. Less considered thoughts can be found on [Twitter][6], while work in progress can be found on [Dribbble][7] and [GitHub][8].
