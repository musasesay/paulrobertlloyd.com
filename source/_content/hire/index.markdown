I've worked for design agencies, start-ups and more established companies in the fields of retail (John Lewis, Nuts.com), publishing (Dennis, *the Guardian*), technology (Mozilla, Ning), media (Channel 4, NBCUniversal) and non-profits (UNICEF UK, DACS).

## Digital Design & Development
{: .u-aside}

### Graphic & Interaction Design
I value cohesiveness, attention to detail, and creating products that can be used by all. In short, I aim to bring Dieter Rams [10 principles of good design][1] to the digital realm.

{% figure u-pull-right "<cite>Harry Brignull, Independent UX Consultant</cite>" %}
> Paul is an excellent designer and front-end developer. He has a lot of experience working with UX designers and researchers, and is comfortable collaborating in that tricky zone where a project is a tangle and needs careful unpicking before being put back together again.
{% endfigure %}

Much of my work is focused on graphic and interaction design for native applications and the web. I also have experience developing brand identities and producing print-based designs. I believe everyone on a project can contribute valuable insights so, where possible, I advocate working alongside other designers, developers and researchers within your organisation.

### Front-end Web Development
I employ pragmatic front-end architecture practices that progressively enhance semantic HTML with modular CSS and unobtrusive JavaScript.

I'm familiar with pre-processors (Sass, Less), task-runners (Grunt, Gulp), content management systems (Jekyll, Kirby, Perch) and project planning software (Jira, Trello). I typically produce documentation such as style guides and pattern portfolios to ensure the code I develop is maintainable and extensible by internal teams once it's been handed over.

### Working With Me
Living in Brighton means I'm within commuting distance of London. I'm also happy to work with companies located further afield, on-site or remotely (but ideally a mixture of the two).

## Public Speaking
{: .u-aside}

I'm an experienced speaker, having featured at events around the UK and Europe including **[Responsive Day Out][2]** and **[CSS Day][3]**. Working at the intersection of graphic design and web development, my talks typically advocate collaborative practice, progressive enhancement, design systems and embracing the universal nature of the web.

I'm currently speaking about [the principles underlying responsive web design][4], but can develop a talk more attuned your particular event or audience.

I believe conferences and meet-ups should offer a safe space for speakers and attendees, so only speak at events that publish and enforce a [Code of Conduct][5].
