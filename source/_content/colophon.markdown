excerpt: This site is built using a variety of third-party tools and services.

This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [TextMate][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Tiempos Text][5] and [Calibre][6], both designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][7] with a number of supporting plugins:

  * [jekyll-archives][8] by Alfred Xing
  * [jekyll-assets][9] by Aleksey V Zapparov
  * [octopress-minify-html][10] by Brandon Mathis
  * [jekyll-sitemap][11] by GitHub, Inc.
  * [jekyll-smartify][12] by Pat Hawks
  * [Simple Jekyll Search][13] by Christian Fei

Other notable tools and services used to build this site include:

  * [converjon][14] by Leon Weidauer
  * [exiftool][15] by Matthew McEachen and Phil Harvey
  * [fontfaceobserver][16] by Bram Stein
  * [Picturefill][17] by Filament Group, Inc.
  * [Susy][18] by Eric M. Suzanne
  * [typogruby][19] by Arjan van der Gaag
  * [MapBox][20] by Mapbox Inc.

I always try to adhere to [web standards][21] and best practices. Pages are semantically structured using valid [HTML5][22] with presentational design provided by [CSS][23]. Syndicated feeds are available using [Atom][24]-flavoured RSS.
