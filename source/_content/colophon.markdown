This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [TextMate][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Tiempos Text][5] and [Calibre][6], both designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][7] and these supporting plugins:

  * [jekyll-smartify][11] by Pat Hawks
  * [jekyll-compress-html][12] by Anatol Broder
  * [Simple Jekyll Search][13] by Christian Fei
  * [Octopress plugins][14] by Brandon Mathis
