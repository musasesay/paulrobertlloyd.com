This website is produced on an Apple [iMac][1], using [OmniGraffle][2] and [Sketch][3] to realise early design concepts before being marked up as HTML in [TextMate][4]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][5] for web hosting. Type set in [FONT][6] and served via [FONT SERVICE][7].

This site is published using [Jekyll][8] and a number of supporting plugins:

  * [PLUGIN NAME][9] by PLUGIN AUTHOR

Additional enhancements:

  * [MapBox][10] interactive maps
  * [ENHANCEMENT][11]

I always try to adhere to [web standards][12] and best practices. Therefore, pages are semantically structured using valid [HTML5][13] with presentational design provided by [CSS][14]. Syndicated feeds are available using [Atom][15]-flavoured RSS.
