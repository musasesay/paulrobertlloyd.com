A huge fan of [_The Colbert Report_][1], although living in the UK meant I wasn't able to watch full episodes, I could often be found howling with laughter as I gorged on the available clips on YouTube. Yet watching the [video shorts][2] that were released prior to Colbert's debut, I sensed a change in comedic direction, and silently wondered if the transition to a mainstream slot would be a painful, and ultimately unsuccessful endeavour.

Now, having watched clips from his first week sat at his desk inside the renovated [Ed Sullivan Theater][3], I'm wondering why I had any doubts. While the new show sticks to the traditional American late night format, enough elements of his previous show remain, and much of the humour remains familiar. [Writing about Stephen Colbert's first night][4] as host of CBS' _The Late Show_, Megan Garber noticed another important similarity:

> [_The Colbert Report_] was notable not just for its satire, but for its intellectualism: It introduced its audience to authors and thinkers who might not get an airing on typical late-night, or for that matter typical news, shows. _The Late Show_'s debut suggested that Colbert might carry on that tradition, expanding it to a wider audience. It suggested a proposition that, until last night, seemed as absurd as it is simple: that late-night comedy, aired on a large network, can be funny and smart at the same time.

On any other show, an interview with Uber CEO [Travis Kalanick][5] would have been fawning and over congratulatory, but Colbert's questions didn't avoid the many controversies that surround this service. It also revealed Kalanick's rather hollow and evasive personality:

With Colbert no longer playing the character of a "[well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot][6]", and with the exaggerated conceit of political punditry stripped away, it appears we may still get the same satire and humour, but with a more open, honest and [warmer host][7]. I think it works.

Which begs the question: will episodes be broadcast in the UK?
