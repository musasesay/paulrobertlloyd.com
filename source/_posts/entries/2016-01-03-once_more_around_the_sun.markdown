I wasn't going to write about 2015, but reading a few end-of-year reviews ([of][1] [varying][2] [length][3]) has encouraged me to attempt the same, so here goes...

Last year started with some unfinished business, seeing out the remainder of my contract at the Guardian in January. Then, after [a month spent with family in Brazil][4], I was able to begin my second stint at freelancing in March. I wrote about some of the [tribulations of this endeavour][5] a few months ago. Thankfully things picked up soon after writing that post.

Besides the trip to Sao Paulo, the year featured plenty of other destinations: [Berlin][6], [Bath][7], [Manchester][8], [Amsterdam][9], [Rotterdam][10], [Bruges][11], [Prague][12], [Budapest][13], [Paris][14] and [Birmingham][15]. My travel was concentrated on cities in the UK or on the continent, and I see no reason for not doing so again this year -- I *love* exploring Europe.

As usual, I attended a number of conferences relevant to my interests (though few saw me venture outside Brighton): [UpFront][16], Responsive Day Out, Edge, [Indie Web Camp][17], dConstruct, Canvas, finishing up with Ampersand, which was far and away the event I enjoyed most.

I also made a concerted effort to attend events beyond the realm of web design. I heard talks about the history of [my local railway station][18], the [design of the Olympic Stadium's new roof][19], and [collecting graphic art][20]. Cultural highlights included my first West End play ([King Charles III][21]), briefly sharing a stage with the comedian [Tony Law][22], and walking among the works of [William Kentridge][23] and [Ai Wei Wei][24]. I also crossed a few local attractions of my to-do list, visiting [Brooklands Museum][25], [Crystal Palace][26] and [Hampton Court Palace][27]. However, of the live sport I saw in 2015, both the FIA Formula E ePrix in Battersea Park and the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games were disappointing.

Between all this, I could be found hunched over a laptop in a coffee shop, writing articles for net Magazine, [A List Apart][28], [24 ways][29] and [the Pastry Box Project][30]. I was also preparing for talks given at [Front-end London][31], [CSS Day][32], and [Web Expo][33] (the locations of which helped dictate the year's travel plans).

Oh, and [I launched my redesigned website][34]. Finally

* * *

So onwards, and on to 2016. Work wise, I've identified two improvements that instigating. Firstly, I need to make better use of any periods of downtime, or better still, be in a position to dictate when they occur. I also want to be in a position where I'm able to work on projects that are, how should I say, more creatively rewarding. My ideal project would be 3-6 months long, possibly involve working in Europe, and have a positive social impact. I need to try much harder at seeking out work that can meet these goals.

Last year I started working with a personal trainer. While this has seen an improvement in my strength and overall fitness, any gains have been offset by a poor diet. I now need to focus on making small but sustainable changes (drink more water, eat more fruit and veg, plan my meals in advance) to fully realise the benefits.

Finally, I'm determined to spend less time in 2016 hunched over my laptop writing and editing long form articles. I'd much rather write shorter posts, more often. Hopefully the time saved by doing that can be invested in reviving [Bradshaw's Guide][35] (a somewhat neglected side-project) and pursuing exhibitions and events that can pull me away from the screen, and satisfy my other interests.
