Slightly late bringing you this months update, but as you will see, there have been a few changes. The obligatory coding improvements (with some visual eye-candy for those not browsing with the standards un-aware Internet Exporer may I add) alongside some actual content for a change. Five -- yes **five** -- new reviews have been added to the new and improved reviews section after much critism from 'Tess the Dog' (thanks Kris!) and Lewis, although still the same three albums! I will add more soon, promise.
