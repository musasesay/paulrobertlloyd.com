Having lived in my current flat for just over two years, I'm determined for this to be the year I finally make it feel like a home.

With three rooms redecorated, only the kitchen and bathroom remain. Yet with both in need of substantial refurbishment, I shifted my focus to the lounge. The television sat perched upon a small table and an oversized L-shaped desk occupying one corner of the room, it was time to look for more permanent replacements. In the rush to furnish a room, I typically end up buying items made of laminated chipboard, only to immediately regret my purchase, my short ownership predictably ending with a guilt-ridden trip to the dump. I wasn't going to make the same mistake again.

With a recess on each side of a chimney breast, I believed these would be wide enough (100-115cm) to accommodate significant pieces of furniture. Yet as I began to look around, my options narrowed as I realised most desks and tables aren't much narrower than 150cm. The high street trampled, charity shops trawled, only a tireless search on the web was left. This brought me to [Etsy][1], where options were more plentiful. It was here that I became drawn to [Habitables][2], a producer of high-quality indie furniture:

> Habitables was born in 2013 with the desire to manufacture and market the ideas and projects designed by us, our intention is to create unique pieces with the best value and quality possible. Based on completely local production, we want to re-enable the craftsman and quality work.

I immediately fell in love with their distinctive mid-century modern furniture, designed by Manuel Barrera in Madrid. With the option to produce items at bespoke sizes, their standard dimensions were already inch-perfect for my needs. More expensive than the ill-fitting furniture I had already seen, it was with a deep intake of breath that I clicked on the 'Buy' button.

My furniture arrived last week, and appropriately packaged for their long trip from Madrid, opening and assembling these pieces felt like Christmas Day all over again. Not so much a purchase but long-term investment, it's one that leaves me with two unique pieces of furniture that I will treasure for many years to come.
