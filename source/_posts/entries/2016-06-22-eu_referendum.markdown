Tomorrow is the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. I've wanted to write about this for some time now, but I've delayed and delayed in the hope I could offer a tidy summary and clear reasoning behind my decision to remain.

An issue in which the facts are muddied shades of grey, the vote demands a simple black or white answer. How could I ever hope to navigate a complex subject which has been distorted by years of inaccurate and biased reporting? How should I approach a subject that can too easily arose emotive reactions, as evidenced by the [tragic murder of Jo Cox MP][1] last week.

Writing anything about the referendum feels contentious, so I feel an immense pressure to write something this is both balanced yet convincing. I have so much I want to say, yet little time left to say it. Where do I even start? Maybe I should start at the beginning.

## My political journey
Born 35 years ago to a middle-income family (dad a telecom engineer, mum a dinner lady), I grew up on a new housing estate in suburban Surrey. Idyllic maybe, but distinctly average. It became slightly less average when aged 13, my family moved to the West Midlands to run a boarding kennel business. Quite a contrast, and the first of many relocations that would offer a new perspective.

A comfortable upbringing meant I had little reason to disbelieve the contents of the Daily Mail, the newspaper my parents read at the time. While I don't recall being an avid reader, its editorial must have had an effect: asked to create a pastiche of a famous painting for a GCSE art project, I reworked Michelangelo's <cite>[The Creation of Adam][2]</cite>, showing [Britain figuratively holding back the forces of Europe][3].

Two decades on, I find this work pretty embarrassing, yet it serves as a reminder of the political journey I've been on since. Its leftwards shift can be traced back to [the short period I lived in the United States][4], where working with a mix of different nationalities broadened my world view significantly.

Today, my political centre of gravity hovers somewhere around the centre, habitually conservative, but persuaded by arguments on the left. At the start of the referendum campaign I was a floating voter, and expected to face a head versus heart decision, perhaps even taming an urge to vote leave and shake things up a bit.

## Cause and effect
I include this background because it's important to remember that everyone brings their own perspectives and bias to this debate. Too often there has been a tendency to group people together: if the media isn't slicing the electorate up into awkward portmanteaus like *Brexiter* or *Bremainer*, then the campaigns have sought to talk in terms of 'us' and 'them'.

When I stop to think about what Europe has or hasn't done for me, I have very little to complain about. But then I have little to complain about anyway. My life has been pretty uncomplicated, a situation born of comparative privilege and stable upbringing. Not everyone is so lucky, which is why societal safeguards -- supporting the cost of higher education, providing social housing, ensuring healthcare is free at the point of use -- should be strengthened, not diminished in pursuit of ignorant political ideologies. The government's policy of aggressive austerity has increased pressure on public services, underfunding institutions and undermining their servants. And now this referendum has allowed a narrative to unfold in which the blame can be pinned on others, be they EU bureaucrats, immigrants or refugees.

## Taking leave of our senses
At the start of the campaign I found some of the arguments fascinating, not least those that focused on democracy, self-government and abstract notions of sovereignty. I found others tiresome, not least when the debate became a proxy for leadership of the Conservative Party.

As the debate wore on, my opinion started to solidify, particularly as Vote Leave's deception became clear: [employing dark patterns on its website][5], posting leaflets claiming to be 'official election information', printing an outright lie on the side of their battle bus, allowing 'experts' to become a derogatory term. The remain campaign wasn't much fun either. If George Osbourne wasn't releasing dubious Treasury statistics, then David Cameron was shooting himself in the foot. The spotlight rarely fell on other voices within the coalition of remain supporters.

With leave campaigners [growing increasingly xenophobic][6] and Remain continuing with its strategy of fear mongering, examination of the organisation whose membership we were being asked to vote on was missing. Step away from the argument for five minutes and look at the detail, you'd realise that many of our complaints about Europe are either self-inflicted or [entirely made up][7].

Is Europe perfect? Far from it. The pursuit of the EU's free-trade agreement with the United States (TTIP) is deeply concerning, yet surely better to negotiate such a deal as part of a trading block of 500 million consumers, than be steamrollered into a worse one done on the basis of a 'special relationship' -- we know which direction that typically operates.

What could we achieve inside Europe if instead of complaining, obstructing and abstaining, we took a more proactive role?

## Brexit and break things
The week that I'm asked to decide on Britain's future relationship with Europe, I find myself visiting a small part of it. As I've walked around Amsterdam and Utrecht, I've seen people like me, bathing in the sunshine or dodging the frequent and heavy rain showers, and enjoying the peaceful lifestyle we've grown accustomed too. It's also one we take for granted. In commemorating the centenary of the first world war and with the cessation of the second 70 years behind us, we should remind ourselves that peace is not the default setting. Europe has been ravished by war in every century bar this one; what would it take to change that? Could Brexit be the catalyst?

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In the aftermath of a deep economic depression, right-wing extremism is again creating a foothold within Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, Russia waits on the sidelines, encouraging instability and devision by [whatever means necessary][8]. Forget breaking point, this year looks more like a tipping point.

## Why now?
Given this situation, why make a decision that could have seismic consequences? Why spend the next ten years negotiating trade deals and our relationship with Europe, when instead we could be combating climate change, encouraging stability in Syria and Middle East and improving relations with Russia. And so much more.

Should we vote to remain, we still have the option in the future to leave, yet if we vote to leave, the decision is irreversible.

I thought I would be voting for [the least worst option][9]. Yet over the last few weeks, as I've watched the dynamics within the leave campaign play out, I see that allowing deceptive and careless voices to [emerge as the most powerful and influential][10] is too dangerous a gamble.

I thought this referendum would come down to a choice between my head and my heart. I now see it as a choice between selfishness or solidarity; isolation or co-operation; ideology or pragmatism, xenophobia or internationalism.

There is so much at stake. And there is still so much I wish to say. But the reasons for voting to remain in Europe are now crystal clear.
