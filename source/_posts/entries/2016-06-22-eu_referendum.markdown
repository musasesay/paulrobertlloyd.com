Tomorrow is the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, and I've wanted to write about it for some time. Such is the complexity of the debate, I've delayed and delayed in the hope I could find a tidy summary of the arguments, and offer a succinct reasoning for my decision to vote to remain.

The [tragic events of last week][1] abruptly put pay to such hopes. In the process of debating a complex issue featuring shades of grey, it feels like as if we may be at the point of unveiling something much darker.

Given this context, while writing anything about the referendum will likely be contentious, I now feel an immense pressure to write something that is both meaningful and convincing. This is also an act of record keeping; once the outcome of the vote has been declared, should it favour leaving, I'll want to know precisely where I stood on this issue.

And yet time is against me. I have so much I want to say, but I hardly know were to start. Maybe I should start at the beginning.

## My political journey
Born 35 years ago to a middle-income family (dad was a telecom engineer, mum a dinner lady), I grew up on a new housing estate on the edge of London's greenbelt. You might describe my childhood as idyllic, but I'd probably call it average. It became slightly less average when aged 13, my family moved from Surrey to the West Midlands to run a boarding kennel business. Quite the contrast, and the first of many relocations to offer a new perspective on things.

This upbringing meant I had no reason to disbelieve the contents of the Daily Mail, the paper my parents read at the time. While I don't recall being an avid reader, the editorial must have had some effect, as by the age of 16, my views on leaving the EU were pretty clear. Asked to create a pastiche of a famous painting for a GCSE art project, I opted to rework Michelangelo's <cite>[The Creation of Adam][2]</cite>, showing [Britain figuratively holding back the forces of Europe][3].

Two decades on, I find this work incredibly cringeworthy, yet it serves as a reminder of the political journey I've been on, one whose leftwards trajectory can be attributed to a short period living in the United States [ten years ago][4]. Working with people from different parts of the world, and from around the US, its unsurprising that my world view should change. It was with the other European members of the team that I found greatest affinity, and soon enough I was sharing a flat in San Francisco with a German and a Spaniard -- almost the basis for a sitcom!

Today, while I'm now a member of the Green Party, my political centre of gravity lies somewhere closer to the centre. This might go someway to explaining why, at the dawn of this referendum campaign, I was a floating voter. Listening to the arguments for both leave and remain, I expected to face a head versus heart decision, or needing to tame my inner imp wanting to tick the leave box just to shake things up a little.

Yet when I stop to think about what Europe has or hasn't done for me, I have very little to complain about. But then I have little to complain about anyway. My life has been pretty uncomplicated so far, a situation born of comparative privilege and a stable upbringing. My parents could afford to support the costs of me going to university, and when I returned home, they were able to support me while I started my career. Not everyone has those opportunities, which is why societal safeguards, be it supporting the cost of higher education, housing or healthcare, are important and worth protecting, not diminished in the name of austerity and an ignorant political ideology.

I share this background, not only because it has undoubtedly effected my decision, but because understanding people's different perspectives and biases are worth considering. Too often this referendum debate has attempted to group people together: if the media isn't slicing the electorate up into awkward portmanteaus like *Brexiter* or *Bremainer*, then the campaigns seek to define 'them' and 'us'.

Members of my family will undoubtedly vote to leave. They have their reasons, not least having originally voted for a trade-based partnership, not a political union. The tenor of this debate has started to resemble that of American politics, where almost no decisions can be made such is the complete eradication of bipartisanship. Rather than ket the debate grows ever more toxic, a degree of empathy is needed for us to understand those who support an opposing argument.

## Taking leave of our senses
Already interested in politics, I watched a fair number of debates, documentaries and interviews, and read countless articles about the workings of Europe and this referendum. At the start of the campaign I found the arguments fascinating, not least those that focused on democracy, self-government and abstract notions of sovereignty. I also found some of them deeply tiresome, especially as the debate acted as a proxy for leadership of the Conservative Party, this amplifying those advocating free-trade and free-markets.

With the referendum entering its final weeks, my opinion started to solidify. The Leave campaign became increasingly unattractive, be it by [using dark patterns on its website][5], sending deceptive leaflets through the door claiming to be 'official election information' or printing an outright lie on the side of their battle bus. And as the campaign started to focus on immigration, on its fringes Farage would [unveil racist posters][6] with [the lingering smell of facism][7].

The remain campaign was no fun either, relying on tried and tested electioneering tactics. When George Osbourne was not releasing dubious Treasury statistics, David Cameron would be shooting himself in the foot. The spotlight rarely fell on other members of the coalition of remain supporters. With Leave growing increasingly xenophobic and Remain continuing with its strategy of fear mongering, the organisation whose membership we are being asked to vote on, was being conveniently being sidelined.

It was only by watching documentaries that [I discovered it was Winston Churchill][8] that first uttered the phrase 'United States of Europe' as a means of promoting a lasting peace on the continent. Surely having everyone play by the same rules, be that in trade or with respect to human rights is in everyones interest? Step away from the argument for five minutes and look at the detail, and you soon realise many of our complaints about Europe are either self-inflicted or [made up by journalists like Boris Johnson][9].

Europe is often described as undemocratic, yet Britain's system of government isn't much better. The House of Lords has the embarrassing status of being the world's largest decision-making body after China's National People's Congress, and all of its members are unelected, as is our head of state. For the 55,000 'unelected bureaucrats' in Brussels, our own Civil Service numbers 393,000. It's also difficult to hear Conservative Leave campaigners talk about the need for greater democracy when their own party is being [investigated for electoral fraud][10] (a fact conveniently ignored during the heat of this referendum).

Is Europe perfect? Far from it. [Jenny Jones of the Green Party][11] notes that its “well-intentioned environmental policies are outweighed at every turn by the more fundamental drivers of its bid to turn the whole of Europe into a paradise for (environmentally damaging) agribusiness and industry”. On the other hand, it's only the European Commission taking companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to task in reaction to their overbearing, monopolistic, unfair trading practices.

The pursuit of the EU's free-trade agreement with the US (TTIP) is deeply concerning, yet members of this government on both sides of the debate wish to see it signed, Far better surely, to negotiate this deal as part of a trading block of 500 million consumers, rather then be steamrollered into a worse deal done on the basis of a 'special relationship'. We know what direction that typically operates.

What could we achieve if instead of complaining, instead of obstructing, instead of abstaining, we took a more pro-active roll within Europe? How might the public's impression change if the activities of its various bodies were more widely reported on? And why was this positive case not being made?

## Brexit and break things
The weak before I'm being asked to make a decision on Britain's future relationship with Europe, it's telling that I should find myself visiting the Netherlands. As I've walked around Amsterdam and Utrecht, I see people like me, enjoying the sunshine or dodging the frequent and heavy rain showers.

Many in the West get to enjoy a peaceful lifestyle, yet it increasingly feels like one we take for granted. As we commemorate the centenary of the first world war, and with the second now 70 years behind us, living memory of war has slowly disappeared and we've grown accustomed to peace, assuming it to be the default. It isn't. Europe has been ravished by war every century except this one. So far.

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In the aftermath of a deep economic depression, right-wing extremism can be found sinking its claws into societies across both Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, Russia waits on the sidelines, encouraging instability and devision by [whatever means possible][12]. Forget breaking point, this year looks more like the tipping point.

Given this situation, why the hell are we making this decision now? Why even consider spending the next ten years focused on trade deals when instead we should be combating climate change. Bringing stability to Syria and Middle East so that refugees can return home. Improving relations with Russia. Campaigning to ensure human rights are protected across the world.

Should we vote to remain, we still have the option in the future to leave, yet a vote to leave is an irreversible decision. Any re-entry into the EU wouldn't include the many vetoes and exemptions successive governments have negotiated over the past 40 years.

Listening to the arguments for and against membership of the EU, at first it felt like I would be voting for the least worst option. Yet over the last few weeks, watching complex dynamics within the Leave campaign play out, and seeing [who might emerge as the most powerful and influential figures][13], I've come to accept that this vote is now a choice between selfishness or solidarity; isolation or co-operation; ideology or pragmatism, xenophobia or internationalism. Leave, or remain.

There is so much at stake. And there is still so much I wish to say.
