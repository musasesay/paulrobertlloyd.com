Tomorrow is the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. I've wanted to write about it for some time, yet I've delayed and delayed in the hope I could offer a tidy summary and clear reasoning behind my decision to remain.

With a debate featuring shades of grey, yet a vote demanding a black and white answer, how could I ever hope to navigate such a complex issue, and one that can too easily provoke an emotive reaction, as evidenced by the [tragic murder of Jo Cox MP][1] last week.

Writing anything about the referendum feels contentious, and I feel an immense pressure to write something that is both meaningful and convincing. And yet time is against me. I have so much I want to say, but I hardly know were to start. Maybe I should start at the beginning.

## My political journey
Born 35 years ago to a middle-income family (dad a telecom engineer, mum a dinner lady), I grew up on a leafy Surrey new-build housing estate. You might describe my childhood as idyllic, but I'd probably call it average. It became slightly less average when aged 13, my family moved to the West Midlands to run a boarding kennel business. Quite a contrast, and the first of many relocations that would offer a new perspective.

My peaceful upbringing meant I had no reason to disbelieve the contents of the Daily Mail, the newspaper my parents read at the time. While I don't recall being an avid reader, its editorial must have had an effect. Asked to create a pastiche of a famous painting for a GCSE art project, I opted to rework Michelangelo's <cite>[The Creation of Adam][2]</cite>, showing [Britain figuratively holding back the forces of Europe][3].

Two decades on, I find this work incredibly embarrassing, yet it serves as a reminder of the political journey I've been on since, one whose leftwards shift can be attributed to [the short period I lived in the United States][4]. Working in a team that featured a mix of nationalities, its not surprising that my world view should broaden. It was with the European members of the team I found greatest affinity, and soon enough I was sharing a flat in San Francisco with a German and a Spaniard -- almost the basis for a bad sitcom!

Today, my political centre of gravity lies somewhere closer to the centre, and at the start of the referendum campaign, I was a floating voter, expected to face a head versus heart decision, perhaps needing to tame my inner imp wanting to vote leave in order to shake things up a bit.

## Cause and effect
I provide this background because it's important to understand everyone has their own perspective and biases. Too often this referendum has grouped people together: if the media isn't slicing the electorate up into awkward portmanteaus like *Brexiter* or *Bremainer*, then the campaigns have sought to talk in terms of 'them' and 'us'. And too often 'them' has been immigrants, convenient scapegoats for the austerity policies enacted by Conservatives that now sit on either side of this debate.

When I stop to think about what Europe has or hasn't done for me, I have very little to complain about. But then I have little to complain about anyway. My life has been pretty uncomplicated so far, a situation born of comparative privilege and a stable upbringing. My parents could afford to support the costs of me going to university, and when I returned home, they were able to support me while I started my career. Not everyone has those opportunities, which is why societal safeguards, be it supporting the cost of higher education, housing or healthcare, are important and worth protecting, not diminished in the name of an ignorant political ideology.

## Taking leave of our senses
At the start of the campaign I found many of the arguments fascinating, not least those that focused on democracy, self-government and abstract notions of sovereignty. I also found some of them deeply tiresome, especially as the debate became a proxy for leadership of the Conservative Party.

As the debate wore on, my opinion started to solidify. Vote Leave became increasingly deceptive: [using dark patterns on its website][5], posting leaflets claiming to be 'official election information' and printing an outright lie on the side of their battle bus. The remain campaign was no fun either. If George Osbourne wasn't releasing dubious Treasury statistics, David Cameron would be shooting himself in the foot. The spotlight rarely fell on other voices within the coalition of remain supporters. 'Experts' became a derogatory term.

With the leave campaigns [growing increasingly xenophobic][6] and Remain continuing with its strategy of fear mongering, the organisation whose membership we were being asked to vote on was conveniently sidelined. Step away from the argument for five minutes and look at the detail, and you soon realise many of our complaints about Europe are either self-inflicted or [made up by journalists like Boris Johnson][7].

Europe is often described as undemocratic, yet Britain's system of government isn't much better. The House of Lords has the embarrassing status of being the world's largest decision-making body after China's National People's Congress, and all of its members are unelected, as is our head of state. For the 55,000 bureaucrats in Brussels, those in our own Civil Service number 393,000.

Is Europe perfect? Far from it. The pursuit of the EU's free-trade agreement with the United States (TTIP) is deeply concerning, yet surely better to negotiate such a deal as part of a trading block of 500 million consumers, rather then be steamrollered into a worse one done on the basis of a 'special relationship'. We know what direction that relationship typically operates.

What could we achieve inside Europe if instead of complaining, obstructing and abstaining, we took a more proactive roll?

## Brexit and break things
The week that I'm being asked to decide on Britain's future relationship with Europe, I find myself visiting the Netherlands. As I've walked around Amsterdam and Utrecht, I've seen people like me, bathing in the sunshine or dodging the frequent and heavy rain showers, enjoying a peaceful lifestyle we've grown accustomed too, one we increasingly take for granted. As we commemorate the centenary of the first world war and the second 70 years behind us, we see peace as the default setting. Yet Europe has been ravished by war in every century bar this one; what would it take to change that? Could Brexit be the catalyst?

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In the aftermath of a deep economic depression, right-wing extremists are again gaining political influence within Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, Russia waits on the sidelines, encouraging instability and devision by [whatever means necessary][8]. Forget breaking point, this year looks more like a tipping point.

Given this situation, why are we making a decision with such seismic consequences? Why should we consider spending the next ten years focused on negotiating trade deals and our relationship with Europe, when instead we could be combating climate change, encouraging stability to Syria and Middle East and improving relations with Russia.

Should we vote to remain, we still have the option in the future to leave, yet if we vote to leave, it is an irreversible decision.

At first it felt like I would be voting for [the least worst option][9]. Yet over the last few weeks, as I've watched the complex dynamics within the Leave campaign play out, and seeing [who might emerge as the most powerful and influential figures if the event of Brexit][10], I've come to see this vote as a choice between selfishness or solidarity; isolation or co-operation; ideology or pragmatism, xenophobia or internationalism.

There is so much at stake. And there is still so much I wish to say. But the reasons for staying in Europe are crystal clear.
