_24 ways_ is an advent calendar for web geeks. Each December, Drew McLellan and his small team publish a daily dose of design and development goodness, delivering a little Christmas cheer to the web community.

The last major redesign was produced by Tim Van Damme in 2007. His innovative design pushed the limits of the medium at the time, but six years later was starting to show its age. Furthermore, the site was failing to reflect the best practices its authors advocated. The site was responsive (thanks to some retroactive hacking) but a fresh approach was needed to effectively deliver content to the broadening range of devices now accessing the site.

## Typography

24 ways is not a commercial venture, so there was no budget to spend on web fonts. With only open source typefaces to choose from, I paired Merriweather (used for headings) with Lato (used for body copy and interface elements).

## Colour

![Small thumbnails depicting articles from different days and years]()

I was keen to explore the idea that each year there would be 24 different articles about web design and development, each by different authors, published on different days, and different years. I created a colour palette based on the publicationâ€™s signature red, that would change over time.

## Shape
![Diamond shape evocative of stars and Christmas trees]()

It seems everyone is using circles these days, so I was determined to create something more distinctive. The diamond shape not only subtly evoked the shape of a star, a possible even stylised Christmas tree, but it help create a visual tension on the page, and frame authors in an interesting and unique way.

## Responsive app-like interface
![Homepage with open menu (tablet)]()  
![Article page (phone)]()

The previous design tended to dominate the content presented within it. I wanted to place content front-and-centre, creating an interface that receded when you were viewing an article, and showcased 24 articles at a time on index pages.

## Modern development practices

Beyond the responsive development, I was keen to employ other best practices. This included the use of BEM-like class names, modular components and conditional loading of non-essential page assets, such as comment threads.
