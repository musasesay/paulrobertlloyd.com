The _University of Wales_ is a confederal university responsible for accrediting degrees for institutions in Wales and for courses provided overseas.

Working with [James Box][1] at Clearleft and with a tight budget and fixed timescale, I created an extensible design language that could be applied across the website, micro sites and the ‘myWales’ social e-learning network.
