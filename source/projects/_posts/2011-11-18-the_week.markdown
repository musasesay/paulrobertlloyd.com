_The Week_ condenses the week's news into lively and informative editorial, giving readers an insight into the most vital stories. With over 183,000 subscribers, it's the UK's most popular weekly subscription magazine.

Part of this success can be attributed to a rigorously consistent editorial format which readers describe as familiar, reliable and intuitive. Working with [Harry Brignull][1] at Clearleft, we were tasked with bringing this much-loved publication to a new generation of tablet users, retaining the best qualities of the print edition while also creating a product true to the best abilities of the iPad.

## Prototyping

We began the design process by starting with paper sketches before proceeding onto the implementation of a quick, low-fidelity prototype. We took this into usability testing and experimented with different design approaches before settling on a formula that was intuitive and easily navigable.

A challenging aspect of this project was attempting to convey the familiarity of the magazine within the confined space of an iPad. Not only is a tablet physically smaller, but its resolution much lower. We retained the predictable IA of the magazine by creating overview pages for each section in the printed magazine that linked though to individual articles. From both index and article pages, users could swipe though the magazine, retaining the skimmable nature of the printed version.

## Result

The app was far more successful than anticipated, spending a number of weeks in the top grossing Top 10 News and Newsstand categories of the UK App Store. The editors of the US and Australian editions were so impressed, they decided to use the same infrastructure and user experience, thus bringing an additional economy of scale.
