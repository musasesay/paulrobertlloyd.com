_Universal Networks_ encompasses NBCUniversal's portfolio of over seventy international television channels. In 2009, these were consolidated into five brands: Syfy, Diva, 13th Street, Studio Universal and Universal Channel. NBCUniversal wanted to create a holistic online user experience across each brand and territory.

Working with [James Box][1] at Clearleft, we devised an underlying user experience and design language, expressed as a common library of localisable design patterns. These were customisable, allowing each brand to exhibit its own individuality and brand personality.
