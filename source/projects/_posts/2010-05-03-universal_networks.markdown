_Universal Networks_ encompasses NBCUniversalâ€™s portfolio of over 70 international television channels. In 2009, these were consolidated into five brands: Syfy, Diva, Studio Universal and Universal Channel. NBCUniversal wanted to create a holistic online user experience across each brand and territory.

Working with [James Box][1] at Clearleft, we devised an underlying user experience and design language, expressed as a common library of localisable design patterns. These were customisable, allowing each brand to exhibit its own individuality and brand personality.

Example implementations can be seen at:

  * [Syfy Universal][2] (UK)
  * [Universal Channel][3] (South Africa)
  * [Studio Universal][4] (Brazil)
  * [13TH STREET Universal][5] (Spain)
