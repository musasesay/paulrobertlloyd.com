_Fontdeck_ is a professional webfont service that allows designers and developers to choose from hundreds of webfonts and easily embed them in their websites.

A unique concept when founders Richard Rutter and Jon Tan conceived the idea in 2009, when the site launched a year later, a number of competing services had since entered the market. The site needed to rapidly evolve, better explain it purpose and how the service differed from others.

## Hack day

With limited time and budget, a small team convened over one weekend to devise a strategy for improving the site. A series of quick wins were identified, but it was agreed that the home page needed a  though overhaul. The existing, text-heavy design failed to communicate the benefits of the product, or explained how it was different to the other services on the market.

The key values of the product were distilled into a compelling proposition: ‘purveyors of the finest web fonts, Fontdeck is the professional webfont solution; easy to use yet flexible enough to meet the real needs of designers'. This became a lightening rod for the design direction that followed.

Improving the product in discreet stages sounded appealing, but beyond a few technical items, making substantial changes soon became difficult. We knew where we wanted to be, but it was difficult to get there without a vision of what the service might look like. Spending several evenings outside of work, I devised a holistic design for the product that would primarily serve these three goals:

  * Communicate professionalism of the service and the quality of our library.
  * Better explain how the service works and how much it costs to use.
  * Give greater prominence to foundries and type designers.

## Typography, colour palette

{% figure "Colour palette" %}

The design used during private and public beta phases of the product roll-out was created by Aegir Hallmundur. While that design no longer aligned with the redefined proposition, elements were retained to form the basis of what followed. The colour palette only required subtle changes; the signature dark blue colour was made slightly dustier, the saturated font category colours more muted.

The original brand font was FF Info, but as this wasn't in our catalogue it didn't make sense to use it. In its place, I paired Adelle (lots of character at different sizes) with PT Sans (really legible at small sizes). Where web safe alternatives were required (e.g. HTML newsletters), Georgia and Lucida Grande were chosen as fallbacks.

## Communicating professionalism
{% figure "Font family page" %}

{% figure "Type specimen page" %}
{% endfigure %}

The layout of pages became more considered, making heavy use of the underlying grid, line rules and a clearer typographic hierarchy. The number of rounded corners used in the design was reduced, with the playing card device limited to use only on a users account and project pages, where they could actually manage their font ‘decks'.

## Describing the product
{% figure "About and pricing pages" %}
{% endfigure %}

The single text heavy about page was replaced by an expanded about section. This included a video narrated by one of the co-founders, provided the background behind the product's development, and introduced members of the team working behind the scenes. A dedicated pricing page was linked from the main navigation, and concisely explained how the various pricing tiers worked.

## Highlighting type designers and foundries
{% figure "Type designer and foundry page" %}
{% endfigure %}

Type designer and foundry pages previously consisted of alphabetical indices of names, but I saw this as an opportunity to make those responsible for our typefaces the heroes of the service. Individual foundry and designer pages now featured a photo or logo and short bio alongside a list of the fonts they had created.
