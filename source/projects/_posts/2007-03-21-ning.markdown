_Ning_ is an online platform that allows people to create, customise and share their own social networks. I was its lead designer from January 2006 to October 2007.

In addition to interaction design and front-end development on the company's initial suite of applications, I was also responsible for the company's branding and product marketing. Later, I worked alongside [David Warner][1] on the development of what became the company's primary product: "Your Own Social Network".
