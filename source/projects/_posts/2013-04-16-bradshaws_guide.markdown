Inspired by the BBC television series _Great British Railway Journeys_, _Bradshaw’s Guide_ is a modern revival of George Bradshaw’s 1866 handbook for tourists exploring Britain’s railways.

In his travelogue, Michael Portillo explores the British railway network, and guided by Bradshaw’s guidebook, compares how the destinations have changed between Victorian and modern times. While you can buy reproductions of Bradshaw’s 1863 handbook, it’s over an inch thick – pocket sized by victorian standards, but not in today’s world of mobile phones. By making Bradshaw’s work more widely accessible, tourists may feel encouraged to spend more time on the railways, or discover hidden beauties they pass everyday.

## Typography
![Typographic hierarchy derived from that used in book]()

Wanting to evoke the feel of the handbook chaotic Victorian typography, I studied how the different typefaces were used, and distilled them to two typefaces, and XX styles.

## Responsive design

The design of the site adapts to the size of the screen; within smaller viewports the site takes on the appearance of mobile app, while on tablet and desktop displays, magazine like layouts start to be used more frequently.

## Integration with social networks
