Broadcast weeknights at 7pm, _Channel 4 News_ is noted for its award-winning coverage of international news and extensive current affairs reporting.

After redesigning their website, Channel 4 wished to re-imagine the Channel 4 News service for tablet and smart phone users. While it would have been easy to repurpose the website, research showed that tablet users demonstrated a more leisurely approach that pointed at a visually-rich, linear solution.

With this insight, and working alongside [James Box][1] and [James Bates][2] at Clearleft, I created an engaging browsing mechanism driven by story headlines and high quality imagery. This made it easy for users to casually flip through stories, honing in on anything that caught the eye.

Shortly after its launch Apple featured it as 'App of the Week'. In a few short weeks the application received over one hundred positive reviews, with an average rating of 4.5 stars.
