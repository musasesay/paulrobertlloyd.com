_nGenera Corporation_ (now [Moxie Software][1]) helps corporations and governments transform themselves into next-generation enterprises through an integrated platform of on-demand technology and innovative business research.

Formally known as BSG Alliance, Steve Douty (President of Platforms, Applications and Marketing) asked me to take their new name and build a brand that could encompass their growing suite of software products and consultation services.

## Brand identity

With an intriguing -- if not immediately obvious -- name, the logo needed to reflect the organisation's broad ambition and signify a break with any past notions of 'enterprise'. The final solution combined an interlocking ‘n’ and ‘G’ with a subtle nod to those icons often associated with networking and connectivity. This distinctive mark could work at many sizes, while flat and rendered versions created to suit range of different applications. In order to encompass a range of operating devisions, a brand architecture was created. This also meant future acquisitions could easily be integrated into the overall business.

## Collateral

While other in-house and third party teams were responsible for implementing the brand, I provided overall guidance and created example collateral pieces such as reports, signage and business cards.

## Website

I sought to distinguish nGenera’s web presence by creating an immersive and premium experience, realised through the use of deep blues accented by highly saturated colours from a complementary palette. Working with [Matt Pearson][2], I produced a [carousel device][3] for use on the homepage that introduced customers to the company’s range of products and services.
