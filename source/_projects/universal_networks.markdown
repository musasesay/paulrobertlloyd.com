Design for a family of five sites representing NBCUniversal's international channel portfolio, including <cite>Syfy Universal</cite>, <cite>Universal Channel</cite>, <cite>13th Street Universal</cite> and <cite>Studio Universal</cite>.

Working alongside [James Box][1], I helped devise a common user experience and underlying design language that worked across different regional editions and also allowed each channel to exhibit its own unique brand personality.

Example implementations can be seen at:

* [Syfy Universal][2] (UK)
* [Universal Channel][3] (South Africa)
* [Studio Universal][4] (Brazil)
* [13TH STREET Universal][5] (Spain)
