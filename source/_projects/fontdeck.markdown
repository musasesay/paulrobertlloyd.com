Using a pure CSS @font-face solution, Fontdeck provides hundreds of web fonts that can be used without the need for complicated text replacement techniques.

Based upon initial designs for the public beta created by [Aegir Hallmundur][1], I realigned the design to give the service a more professional feel. This was achieved by pairing the distinctive [Adelle][2] typeface for headings with the incredibly legible [PT Sans][3] for body copy. The colour palette was also modified, using desaturated colours that could be aligned with different font categorisations.
