Two days up north.

## 26th June 2003: Manchester then Carlisle

### Pop Idol Foolery
Having got up at 5:15am, I approached Manchester at about 7:45 with plenty of time to spare. However, an accident on the motorway and then getting completely lost (due to poor directions and an unreadable map) meant time was running out.

It soon became evident that me making a tit of myself on the telly was not meant to be when after finding somewhere to park, I preceded to lock myself out of my car! This was clearly a day I should have stayed in bed.

After sorting out my car, a wonder around the city saw me hoodwinked into giving £60 a year to NCH, although a worthwhile cause. Nearly getting run over by a bus, and not realising (until it was too late) that I was walking around with a massive black mark on my face and there was no doubt in my mind this day had become a disaster!

### Carlisle: Better to visit when you don't have too!
Carlisle was sunny! I stayed round Simon and Sarah's new place, and very nice it is too. The day got worse upon seeing Sarah's new Clio, as it's exactly the same as mine but cleaner, more reliable, (not white) and £1200 cheaper. Not good. The night was spent at the Circle Bar and Robertson's, two new clubs among the many other attractions Carlisle has seemingly gained since I left. I'm not happy. Needless to say, the Vodka Red Bulls did a fine job of keeping me awake that night!

## 27th June 2003: CIA's Final Show
I didn't think I'd say this but I was impressed, with a lot of very good work on show this year and far better than the last. A chance to see a few familiar faces, including Dave Ashton (who is now a fully qualified arse wipe), Di Canio, Dave Chapel, Johnny, Pete... and yet I also managed to avoid Sandy! This was then followed by a meal with Sarah, Simon and his parents -- a free meal too, so a big thanks to them!
