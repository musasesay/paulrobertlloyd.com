As experiences go, this 're-union' sure was one. Having not seen Stacy, Aime√© and Sarah for 5 years, conversation became very much limited to "How you been?" and "What you doing nowadays?" and not much else. Dan and Jon decided to ease the pain with much alcohol and got totally pissed, so in the end quite a funny old night!

A very interesting evening, making me realise just how much I've changed -- and how much everyone else has too.
