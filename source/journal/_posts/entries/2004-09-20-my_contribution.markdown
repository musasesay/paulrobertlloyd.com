As [Mozilla's Firefox][1] quickly approaches 1.0, there's a campaign currently running to spread the word. A simple task you would think, when this browser blocks pop-ups, spy-ware and other malicious software. These features are not recent additions either, they are at the core of the application. There is also an AdBlock extension, allowing you to browse sites without having to see a single banner add (be it an image or flash). It's also totally standards compliant -- which may upset the standards slackers at Orange Vision -- but makes the web far easier to design for.

Do yourself a favour and at least [give it a go][2]. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
