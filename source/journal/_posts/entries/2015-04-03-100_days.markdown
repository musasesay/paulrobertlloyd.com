Although Clearleft was first on my list of companies I'd like to freelance for, I was hesitant about having them be my first client, as doing so might throw into question [my decision to leave][1] in the first place.

Thankfully, returning straight away has actually validated that decision. [My 14 month-long experiment][2] at the Guardian, while it produced few tangible outcomes, has provided a bedrock of experience which I can build upon. In fact, I've been surprised by how often I've refered back to my time there during conversations with the project team at Clearleft, and with our client John Lewis.

I also returned to 68 Middle Street in time for the start of _100 days_ [a collaborative project][5] in which several members of the team aim to complete and document a creative process [every day for one hundred days][4]. This is less about producing a set of 100 consistent great designs, but rather an exercise in perseverance; as Woody Allen said "Eighty percent of success is showing up". The project started on 23 March and runs until 1 July 2015.

For this project I've chosen to create a single-line drawing each day, a constraint that should help me produce a coherent body of work yet also allow a degree of flexibility as I progress.

12 days in, and I'm still enjoying the challenge, mainly as I've yet to fully master it. Illustrations have ranged from minimalist to expressive; some are quite detailed, others look more like deranged scribbles! I used to draw quite regularly as a child, but as graphic design drew me ever closer to the computer screen, the habit receded. It'll be interesting to see if this project reverses that trend.
