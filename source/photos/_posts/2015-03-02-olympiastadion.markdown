A common aspect of my travels is visiting [former Olympic stadiums][1], and my trip to Berlin was no different. Germany has an unfortunate history relating to the Olympics; I had previously visited [the site of the 1972 massacre in Munich][2], and here I was visiting the centrepiece of Hitler's orchestrated event of 1936. Tourism can sometimes feel like a very crass activity.
