As Christmas Day quickly approaches, I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has read my humble blog over the last year, and for the comments, feedback and support over what has been another interesting 12 months.

My review of 2007 will follow later in the week, but in the meantime, enjoy your holiday parties, be safe, and **have a very Merry Christmas!**
