    I’ve only been here about half a day now, and half of that has been spent in this internet cafe trying to sort out a group e-mailing list!

    **The highlights so far**
    Flight from London to Bangkok was long and hard -- seated on the toilet during turbulence was an experience too far! The last leg from Bangkok to Sydney was far more enjoyable -- mainly due to being able to watch 'American Wedding'.

    Upon arriving we met John and Kris at the airport, who then drove us round Sydney (that is to say they got lost!) before dropping us off at the hostel. A little walk round the old place -- lots to be seen and done.

    Hope everyone is surviving without me (likely) but to be fair I'm in Australia -- it's amazingly beautiful, and I've only seen a tiny bit!
