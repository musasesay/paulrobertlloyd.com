I don't --usually-- __never__ post comical e-mails I've received to this site, but I think this site needs some cheering up of late, so I present Murphy’s Lesser Known Laws...

* Light travels faster than sound. This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.
* He who laughs last, thinks slowest.
* Change is inevitable, except from vending machines.
* Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don’t.
* The 50:50:90 rule: Anytime you have a 50:50 chance of getting something right, there’s a 90% probability you’ll get it wrong.
* If you lined up all the cars in the world end to end, someone would be stupid enough to try to pass them, five or six at a time, on a hill. In the fog.
* The things that come to those who wait will be the things left by those who got there first.
* Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will sit in a boat all day drinking beer.
* The shin bone is a device for finding furniture in a dark room.
