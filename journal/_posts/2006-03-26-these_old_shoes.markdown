I can't help but feel that this blog is getting a little self-involved. So instead I want to talk not about me, but a pair of old trainers, that after three years of loyal service are going into retirement.

I wouldn't ordinarily blog about items of clothing, but I feel a certain affection for these old friends. You see, they have enjoyed quite a journey during their lifetime, traveling further than any of their predecessors.

Okay, I admit it. This is a veiled attempt to talk about me! I just find it fascinating that the last three years have seen me travel much further than I ever have before, yet on the grand scale of things there is still so much more to see.

My new trainers have a lot to live up to.
