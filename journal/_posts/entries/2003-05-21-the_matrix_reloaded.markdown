The first instalment of the Matrix amazed me in so many ways. Visually stunning and innovative film with an original and thought provoking story-line, and many regard it hardly. For any sequel this was a hard act to follow, and this film had a lot of high expectations laboured upon it.

Whether or not a sequel could ever do justice to the original, this film clearly doesn't, mainly as it piggy-backs on the success of the first and tries to repeat it. This is especially true in terms of visual effects: bullet time being used unnecessarily, and some of the CGI poor considering the original was highly applauded.

The storyline, although flabby in places doesn't disappoint however, to the extent that I really needed the loo but held on right to the end! The film provides some interesting theories on life too. Merovingian, a funny Frenchman providing a very interesting take: "you get drunk, you need a piss -- cause and effect". If only I had his powers of seduction, I would also be spending a lot more time in expensive restaurants!

At the end of it all, Warner Brothers will want to know if I'm sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the third part of the film ‘Revolutions’. Honestly, I can't wait!
