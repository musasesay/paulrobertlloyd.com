excerpt: The latest comedy from Todd Phillips
---
A couple of weeks before watching this film I watched Old School. Fully expecting a straight to video affair, I was immensely surprised.

That film, along with Road Trip were directed by Todd Phillips, who would seem like a rising star in Hollywood -- his next film being a remake of another TV to film remake -- 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It would seem like I'm becoming a fan.

Staring familiar comic partners Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, alongside Snoop Dog cast as Huggy Bear, the films real star is Will Ferrell as a dragon obsessed convict.

There are many scenes in this film that will have you laughing out loud -- for me (having watched all the preview clips and so expecting a lot of the best laughs) the part in which Owen Wilson is seen to be wearing just a face towel, is not only hilarious, but well set up.

Add to the mix Amy Smart and Carmen Electra -- it becomes hard to hate this film. (Now, cue obvious insertion into review of the films best catch phrase...) if you haven't seen this film already: do it. DO IT!
