Although totally predictable, this film is entertaining and endearing in its own way.

It goes without saying that Rowan Atkinson makes this film his own, Natalie Imbruglia does a sterling job as the love interest, but I felt Ben Miller could have been given more script as his talent was a little wasted. As for John Malkovich, I couldnâ€™t help but find this a very strange casting decision -- he doesn't fit into this film at all -- probably due to his dodgy French accent.

Its in the last ten minutes or so that this film saves itself however, with some massive payoffs and comedy performances. An entertaining film, but little more than that.
