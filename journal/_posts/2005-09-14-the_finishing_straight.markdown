As this Sunday's Great North Run looms ever closer, I have finally pulled my finger out and super-charged all efforts to try and reach the magic £500 total I am aiming to raise for the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK.

E-mail and text message campaigns, blog posts, websites (including at the last the launch of [a dedicated running page][1]) and general badgering continues to help push the total forwards.

## Hall of Fame
Below is a list of all those who have all brilliantly pledged sponsorship and support so far -- hopefully this list will continue to grow and grow in the final days before Sunday's big run!

If you would like to add your name *it's easy*! All you need to do is visit [my just giving page][2], fill in a form or two and ta-da -- you've helped make my run just a little bit easier, as well as help countless others who will benefit from the money raised.
