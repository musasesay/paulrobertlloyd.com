Sadly the final <cite>Mark and Lard</cite> show on Radio 1. Though I tend not to listen as much as I used to, they will still be very much missed. Many an art lesson was spent listening to these two chancers, as were afternoons in Carlisle when I probably should have been doing something more important. It really was the biggest show -- cheers guys!
